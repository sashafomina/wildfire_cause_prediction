# wildfire_cause_prediction

This work was part of a class project.
Collaberators: Sasha Fomina and Thai Khong

## Overview
Using data about the size, location, and time of reported wildfires, we predicted their cause. 
These wildfires were reported from the states of California and Georgia from 1992 to 2015,
from small flames to massive forest fires. 
The causes of a fire have been categorized into 4 labels:
* LABEL of 1: the fire originated from a natural cause (Lightning).
* LABEL of 2: the fire originated from an accidental cause (in order of decreasing frequency: Debris
Burning, Equipment Use, Children, Campfire, Smoking, Railroad, Powerline, Fireworks, Structure).
* LABEL of 3: the fire originated from a malicious cause (Arson).
* LABEL of 4: the fire originated from another cause (Miscellaneous, or Missing/Undefined).
